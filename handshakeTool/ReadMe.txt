Guide to Using a Tool to Capture Handshake Packets for Wireless Networks
Introduction

The handshake packet is a crucial part of the security protocol used in wireless networks. This packet is used to confirm the connection between the user and the access point. Capturing and analyzing this packet can help in testing the security of wireless networks and identifying vulnerabilities. In this article, we will discuss how to use a tool to capture a handshake packet, with a focus on using an external network card that supports monitor mode and packet injection.
Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

    External network card that supports monitor mode and packet injection, preferably named wlan1.
    Code file used in the process (referred to here as code).

Detailed Steps

Step 1: Make the Code File Executable

To run the code file, you first need to make it executable. This can be done using the following command in the terminal:


chmod +x code

Step 2: Run the Tool

After making the file executable, run the tool using the following command:


bash code

Step 3: Enter the Username

The system will prompt you to enter the current username of the device. Enter the username when asked.

Step 4: Display List of Nearby Networks

The tool will start scanning for nearby wireless networks and display a list of them. When you see the target network on the screen, press Ctrl + C to stop the scan.

Step 5: Select the Target Network

After stopping the scan, you will be asked to select the target network from the list by entering its number. Enter the appropriate number for the network you want to target.

Step 6: Display List of Users

The tool will then display a list of users connected to the target network. When this list is displayed, press Ctrl + C to stop the display.

Step 7: Select the User's MAC Address

You will be prompted to enter the MAC address of the user on the network. Enter the MAC address accurately.

Step 8: Obtain the Handshake File Path

After entering the MAC address, an instruction screen will appear. Do not press any key during this stage, as the screen will disappear after 15 seconds and provide you with the path to the handshake file, highlighted in green.
Conclusion

By following these steps, you will be able to capture a handshake packet successfully. It is important to emphasize using these tools legally and ethically, and to comply with local laws regarding the use and testing of wireless network security.

Using this guide, you can start testing the security of your wireless network and ensure it is protected against potential threats. If you are a beginner, it may take some time to get used to the commands and procedures, but with practice, you will be able to master them
